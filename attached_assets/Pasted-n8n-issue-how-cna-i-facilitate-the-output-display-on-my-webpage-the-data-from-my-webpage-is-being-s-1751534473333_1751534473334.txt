To display the output from your n8n workflow back on your webpage, you need to ensure that your workflow:

Processes the input sent from your webpage

Returns a proper HTTP response via the Webhook node

Your frontend is waiting for the response and handling it correctly

✅ Workflow Structure in n8n
Let’s say your flow is:

scss
Copy
Edit
Webhook (POST) → Processing (e.g., LLM or Function Node) → Return Response
Here’s how to ensure it works step-by-step:

🔧 Step 1: Setup the Webhook node properly
Set the Webhook node to POST method.

Set the Response Mode to:

On Received — if you want to return a quick "received" response immediately

✅ Last Node — if you want to wait and return the final processed output to the frontend (most common)

Example Settings:
HTTP Method: POST

Response Mode: Last Node

Response Code: 200

Response Content Type: JSON (default)

🧠 Step 2: After processing, return the result properly
Let’s say you're calling an LLM API or using OpenAI node:

The last node before the webhook ends should return an object like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "message": "LLM Response here",
  "status": "success"
}
If using a Function Node to format the response:

js
Copy
Edit
return [
  {
    json: {
      message: $json["your_processed_output"],
      status: "success"
    }
  }
];
🖥️ Step 3: Your Frontend JavaScript (example)
Your page should use fetch() or axios to POST data and receive the response:

js
Copy
Edit
fetch("https://your-n8n-domain/webhook/your-webhook-id", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ input: "Hello from frontend" })
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log("LLM Response:", data.message);
  // ✅ display on page
  document.getElementById("response").innerText = data.message;
})
.catch(err => console.error("Error:", err));
🧪 Debug Checklist
Checkpoint	✅ Description
🔁 Workflow executes?	Does the workflow trigger when your frontend sends data?
🧩 Response Mode = Last Node?	So the webhook waits for the final result
🧠 Final node returns JSON?	Ensure a clean structured response is returned
🌐 Is frontend receiving JSON?	Try using Postman/cURL first to test response
🌍 Is your webhook public?	If using n8n in local/dev mode (localhost), the webhook must be exposed (e.g., via ngrok)

✅ Optional Tip: Using Respond to Webhook node
If your flow branches or has multiple outcomes, you can use the Respond to Webhook node directly anywhere in the flow to send a custom response early.
